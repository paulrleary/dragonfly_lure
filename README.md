##First time setup:
I recommend setting up a python virtual environment to run this code. To do this, in the terminal, navigate to whichever folder you wish to contain your main functions. The command to create the environment is:
python3 -m venv *name_of_your_environment*

commonly run as:
python3 -m venv .venv

To use your environment, you must activate it:
source .venv/bin/activate

to deactivate the environment simply run: deactivate

With your environment activated, from the serial_driver folder, run:
pip install -r requirements.txt
